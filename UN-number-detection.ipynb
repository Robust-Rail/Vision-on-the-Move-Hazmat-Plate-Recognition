    "For this project, we have been tasked with developing a machine learning model capable of recognizing UN number hazard plates. These plates, commonly displayed on freight train wagons, indicate the types of hazardous materials being transported. The successful implementation of this model will contribute to a more efficient and secure railway system across the EU.\n",

    "\n",
    "The hazard plates play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of transportation by providing essential information about the nature of the substances on board, such as flammability, toxicity, or corrosiveness. By automating the recognition process with machine learning, the handling and tracking of these hazardous materials can be streamlined, reducing manual labor and minimizing potential human errors.\n",

    "#### Background\n",
    "The specific expectations and objectives of the EU for this project are not yet fully defined, but the initiative's roots are clear. This project is spearheaded by the University of Twente, with researcher Mellisa Tijink serving as our supervisor. Our team, composed of pre-master's Computer Science students, has been tasked with developing the machine learning model. Mellisa Tijink plays a pivotal role as the intermediary between our team and major stakeholders, including ProRail, the EU, and other experts in the field.\n",

    "This project is part of a broader initiative aimed at enhancing rail freight operations within Europe, aligning with the EUâ€™s goals for improved efficiency and safety. More information on the initiative can be found on the official project site: [EU Rail FP5](https://projects.rail-research.europa.eu/eurail-fp5/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Flagship Project 5: *TRANS4M-R aims to establish rail freight as the backbone of a low-emission, resilient European logistics chain that meets end-user needs. It focuses on two main technological clusters: 'Full Digital Freight Train Operation' and 'Seamless Freight Operation', which will develop and demonstrate solutions to increase rail capacity, efficiency, and cross-border coordination. By integrating Digital Automatic Coupler (DAC) solutions with software-defined systems, the project seeks to optimize network management and enhance cooperation among infrastructure managers. The ultimate goal is to create an EU-wide, interoperable rail freight framework with unified technologies and seamless operations across borders and various stakeholders, boosting the EU transport and logistics sector.*\n",
